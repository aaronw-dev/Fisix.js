A vanilla JavaScript-based spring simulation. Change parameters in ```script.js```. Will implement a GUI soon.

## To Do
- [x] Add velocity reflection on contact
- [x] Implement "closest point on polygon" algorithm
- [ ] Implement spring algorithm

## Development Log
**3/8/2023 11:20AM** Rewrote physics engine using a [physics theory video by Gonkee](youtu.be/kyQP4t_wOGI)  
**3/9/2022 1:30PM** Added functionality to draw lines between balls  
**3/10/2022 12:40PM** Implemented basic collision functions  
**3/11/2022 10:19PM** Finished implementing collision, need to implement spring systems.
